## Introduction

Use the proceeding steps to create an IBM Cloud Function action.

You can edit the actions to include the sample code that is provided and test the retrieval of verifications for a specific case or person.
For information about how to invoke your action or to view other troubleshooting issues, see [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting/invoke-a-function.md).

## Create an action

The following steps outline how to create an action:

1. Go to the [IBM Cloud catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog).
2. Search for `Functions`.
3. Click the `Functions` service.
4. Click `Start Creating` > `Action`.
5. Type your Action name, for example `caseworker`.
6. If you have not already created a package named `curam-rest`, click `Create Package`, enter `curam-rest` and click `Create`. Otherwise select `curam-rest` from the `Enclosing package' dropdown.
7. Click `Node.js` as the runtime language.
8. Click `Create` to create your action. You can now start editing the action.
9. To create an action for `verifications` and `person` repeat the steps above.
