IBM® Cúram Social Program Management was enhanced in version 8.0 to support integration with IBM® Watson™ Assistant for the caseworker application.

Caseworkers can ask about outstanding verifications on a case or client or ask about common caseworker procedures.

This cookbook provides you with sample dialog skills, actions, and guidance so you can quickly set up your own virtual assistant.

First, download and deploy the sample skills and actions to IBM Watson Assistant and IBM Cloud Functions. Then, configure SPM to set up the IBM Watson Assistant integration to get the sample caseworker assistant up and running.

### Citizen Virtual Assistant

As part of the version 8.0.1 release, a new asset has been developed for a citizen-facing virtual assistant.  See the section labeled [Virtual citizen assistant](ce/overview) for more information.
