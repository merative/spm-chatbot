## IBM Cloud Services

You will need:

+ An IBM Cloud account.
+ An instance of an IBM Watson Assistant service.
+ Access to IBM Cloud Functions.

All of the above may be done through the [IBM Cloud site](https://cloud.ibm.com/).

### Decide how you want to set up your IBM Watson Assistant and IBM Cloud Functions instances

The following list outlines two scenarios that you can use:

+ Use an IBM Watson Assistant and IBM Cloud Functions instance on the IBM public cloud.
+ Deploy IBM Watson Assistant and IBM Cloud Functions on your private cloud or data center by using IBM Red Hat OpenShift and IBM Cloud Pak for Data.

See the [Deployment options](/architecture/deployment-options) for more information.

## Merative Social Program Management

+ SPM version 8.0 or higher.

<InlineNotification>

In order for Watson Assistant to be able to connect back to SPM to retrieve information about cases, clients or verifications, SPM must be deployed on a publicly accessible URL and not running behind a firewall.

If SPM is deployed behind a firewall, or running in a development environment in Tomcat, the only information the virtual assistant will be able to return will be in relation to Caseworker Procedures.
