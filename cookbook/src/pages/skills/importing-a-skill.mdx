The SPM chatbot repository comes with a pre-configured IBM Watson Assistant skill that can be used as a starter kit.

Note: To import the skill, you need an IBM Cloud account and you need access to the IBM Watson Assistant service.

The following list outlines how to import the skill:

1. Log in to the [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com/login?state=%2Fcatalog%2Fservices%2Fwatson-assistant).
2. Using the Watson Assistant service, follow the [instructions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/assistant?topic=assistant-backup#backup-import-skill) to import the `CaseworkerAssistantDemo.json` skill from the `skills` directory in the Git repository.
