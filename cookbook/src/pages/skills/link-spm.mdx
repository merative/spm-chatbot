The following section details how to create a link in the Virtual Assistant that will link to a page in IBM® Cúram Social Program Management. In this example a URL link is configured in a dialog skill to link to the person notes list page.

1. Log into [IBM Cloud](https://cloud.ibm.com).
2. Select ‘Launch Watson Assistant’.
3. Select the chatbot dialog skill created.
4. Create a new intent and enter the intent name, for example `#SPL_See_The_Case_Notes_Link`.
5. Add a new dialog node to the skills.

   * Enter the node name, for example `See The Case Notes Link`.
   * Enter `If assistant recognizes` with a value `#SPL_See_The_Case_Notes_Link` from the intent created above.
   * Enter the `Then set context` variable names and values used within this node to create a link. In this example set the following context variables:

   | Context variable  name | Value   | Description |
   | --------- | ----------- | ------- |
   | `uim` | Person_listNote | The uim link for a persons notes list page. |
   | `concernRoleID` | $personID | The page parameter name and value required for the url to access the application page. |
   | `preferredTabList` | PersonHome | The `preferredTabList` defines the navigation tab required to navigate to the correct page where there are multiple paths to access this page within the application. |
   | `pretext` |  | The text shown before a link within the chatbot. If there is no pretext the value is empty. |

6. Select to open the JSON editor
   * The context variables defined above can be viewed and edited within the JSON definition.
   * Add the `user_defined` JSON object as shown below in the code extract. The parameters are defined within the JSON `user_defined` properties including `path`, `response_body` and `preferred_tab_list`.
   * The full context pattern `<?context['<context variable name>']?>` is used for text variables or the short place holder format where the attribute is preceded by the dollar character `$`.
   For example `$<context variable name>` is used to hold an attribute value. The attributes are then inserted in to the user defined property values at run time.

  ```
		 {
			"output": {
			    "generic": [
			      {
			        "user_defined": {
				        "name": "responseWithNavigation",
				        "path": "<?context['uim']?>?concernRoleID=$personID",
				        "action_text": "See client notes for $personFullName",
				        "response_body": "<?context['pretext']?>",
				        "preferred_tabs_list": "<?context['preferredTabList']?>"
			        },
			        "response_type": "user_defined"
			      }
			    ]
			},
			"context": {
			    "uim": "Person_listNote",
			    "pretext": "",
			    "concernRoleID": "$personID",
			    "personFullName": "$personFullName",
			    "preferredTabList": "PersonHome"
			}
		 }
  ```

* Open the calling dialog node and select 'Jump to' from the dropdown in the `Then assistant should` section. Select the node `#SPL_See_The_Case_Notes_Link` created above to jump to.

* Test the link in the running application and validate the link opens the correct page in the application.

Alternatively the links can be added to the JSON Editor response body or returned as a parameter from a Cloud Function action.
The parameter values to create the links can be user input, values returned from a Cloud Function action or values defined as context variables set in other dialog nodes.
